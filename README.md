# Spam_Detection
I. Introduction
Overview of the project and its purpose
Explanation of message spam and its impact
Brief discussion of techniques used in message spam detection
II. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collecting a dataset of messages (both spam and non-spam)
Preprocessing the data by removing stop words, stemming, and other techniques
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
III. Feature Extraction and Selection
Converting the preprocessed text into a numerical format
Selecting the most relevant features for the classification task
Exploring different feature extraction techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings
IV. Model Training and Evaluation
Training different machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest
Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Comparing the performance of the different models and selecting the best one
V. Deployment
Building a user interface for the spam detector using a web framework
Deploying the model on a cloud platform or locally
Testing the spam detector with new messages and ensuring its accuracy
VI. Conclusion
Summary of the main findings and accomplishments of the project
Reflection on the limitations and potential future directions of the project.
